                <p class="text">Sadhguru: Mount Kailash is the greatest mystical library. People have been making the pilgrimage there for the last few thousand years. Generally people say 10,000 to 12,000 years, many people say it is much more than that. <br> <br>
                    When the perception of great beings opened up and they came to know of life in a far deeper way than people normally know it, there was no way for them to share it with anyone because it was not in people's perception.They always sought out a few people who could be used to download this knowledge into, but they were not always successful.

                <p class="text">It is very, very rare for any Master to find people he can transmit all of himself to. Most of the Masters go without ever being able to transmit what they really want to transmit.
                    <br> <br>I would say even in my life, what I can do in terms of imparting and what I am doing is just 2% of what I am. If I can increase it by one percentage point before I fall dead that is a great achievement. So where do you leave all this? You do not want this to go lost.

                        Generally, in India most yogis and mystics always chose mountain peaks because they were not frequented by people, they were safe places. They chose rocks to deposit their knowledge in an energy form. <br> <br> For thousands of years, realized beings always traveled to Mount Kailash and deposited their knowledge in a certain energy form. They used this mountain as a basis and created this. It is because of this that Hindus say Shiva lives there. </p>

                         </div>
                         <p class="text">When we say it is the Abode of Shiva, it does not mean that he is still sitting up there or dancing or hiding in the snow or something. In the yogic culture we donâ€™t see Shiva as God, we see him as the Adiyogi, the first yogi, and the Adi Guru, the first Guru. Right from Shiva, many yogis from all traditions stored everything they knew here in a certain energy form. <br> The Greatest Library <br> 
                            If you are going to Kailash, you are like an illiterate person going to a huge library. Let's say you are illiterate and you walk into a mega-library. Everybody is sitting there and reading all these books. You don't know a word of it, but you will be overwhelmed. If you want to read it, you have to start from ABC.</p>
